Welcome to RobCops! Today you made the best decision of your life to play our game!


As you can tell from the title, you can play as a cop or as a robber, both with unique playstyles!


First you need to create your account, after that you can select which side you want to play as.


############################### VERY IMPORTANT, AFTER REGISTRATION, GIVE YOUR PHONE LOCATION PERMISSION, THEN LOGOUT AND LOG BACK IN TO SAVE THE CHANGES ###########################################################


Congratulations! You are now in the RobCops World! Let's start with the Cops and what they can do




###############################  COPS #################################### 




As a starting player you will receive 20 000 Dollars, and can now place your first safe! In order to do that, "select Place Safe" at the bottom of the screen, and select which safe you want to place. Important to note is that you cannot place a safe 


inside buildings or on a safe. So, go outside, and find the best location for you to place the safe! After you have placed a safe you will receive money per hour depending on how many safes you have placed. The more safes you have places the more money 


you will earn. Eventually a robber will attempt to crack open your safe! You will be notified about it. Don't panic! Get to the place where you placed it. If you are fast enough you can catch the robber in the act and give him a ticket. This will 


immediately stop his minigame, arrest him, and take 50% of his cash away. Or you can choose to not give him a ticket, which will increase your corruption experience.




--------------------------------------------------- Corruption --------------------------------------------------------


Every Robber and Cop has the option of switching teams, by giving the other side help. Police Officers can receive hints from robbers about a potential RobUnion Location. This will increase the robbers Cop XP and should he have enough, he can switch to  


a Police Officer and play as one! From the other perspective, as previously mentioned, police officers can choose to not give a ticket to the robbers, which in turn increases their Robbers Experience! Should he have enough he can switch to a robber and 


play as one.




Coming back to the Police Officers, throughout your journeys, you will encounter fellow Police Officers. Together you can combine your powers and create a police station giving every member multiple advantages:


--------------------------------------------------- Police Station ----------------------------------------------------


In order to join a Police Station you join an already existing one or you create a brand new one. Regardless of how you join a Police Station, when you are there, you can cooperate with multiple fellow police officers. Down below is a "DONATE" Button, 


There you can give half of your money and donate it to the police station. When the police station has enough money, you can buy upgrades from your squad! The weapon and armor upgrades give you a better chance at solving the minigames. At the top, if 


you click the Police Station Button, you will see a menu detailing the location of the RobUnion, depending on how many hints you have received from robbers. Existing the menu, at the top right corner you will find a button that leads to a menu where 


you can see the members that are in your Police Station. 


When you get all five clues on the location of the RobUnion you will receive the Longitude and Latitude of the RobUnion! So get over there, and let's attempt to catch the Robbers! 




--------------------------------------------------- Rob Union Raid -------------------------------------------------


When you get to the RobUnion, you can attempt to break into, but be warned! Attempting to break into a RobUnion *ON YOUR OWN* is a bad idea, especially if the RobUnion is not a Level 1 RobUnion. So get some of your fellow officers, and together attempt 


solve various Minigames to catch the robbers. Each player will recieve different games or can even recieve the same games. See more in the MINIGAMES Section. If you successfully catch the robbers, they will lose some of their money, and the cops will 


recieve money! Fantastic! 


So now you know everything about Police Officers in the world of RobCops! Let's move on to the Robbers!




############################### ROBBERS #################################




The objective of robbers is to crack open safes and steal the money. Robbers have to wander around and find safes; Once they have found a safe, they can attempt to crack it! These Safes are places by a Police Officer, or in case there aren't any Safes 


in your area, safes will be placed in your area, go out there and find them!


First they join a lobby, where they can wait for other robbers, or buy C4 or Wire Cutters. C4 damages the safe, and the wire cutters give you more time to crack the safe. Robbers have to solve specific games to crack the safe.


--------------------------------------------------- Gameplay --------------------------------------------------------


Whether you are a cop or a robber you will receive various minigames to complete in order to achieve what you are trying to do. There are three different Minigames: 


The first one is a Safe clicker game, your objective is to click the safe (for robbers) / the door (for cops) on your screen as much as you can in Order to do a lot of damage. 


The second one is a maze rotation game. Here you have to rotate your phone and bring a ball to the green area in order to do damage.


The last one is a memory game. Here you have to select 2 blocks and see if the colors of the safe match. You have to select all the correct tuples to do damage.


The minigames are selected at random, so always be prepared to crack the safe / raid the RobUnion.


Returning to Robbers, like the Cops you have a RobUnion, a place where you and your friends can join and work together to steal a lot of safes.










---------------------------------------------------- RobUnion  ------------------------------------------------------


Here you can also donate money towards the RobUnion with the button "DONATE" at the bottom of the screen, which immediately takes half of your cash and puts it into the RobUnion. You can also see which members are part of the RobUnion at the top right 


corner of the screen. Using the money from RobUnion, you can purchase Money Machines, which will grant you money over time. By clicking the "Rob Union" Button at the top of your screen, you can gain more information on your RobUnion. You can buy 


C4s, which, as previously mentioned, will damage the safe, or wire cutters, which increases the time you have to crack the safe. 


Whether you are a cop or a robber, you can buy some personal upgrades in order to help you in your mission


------------------------------------------- Personal Upgrades ----------------------------------------------------


Each player, regardless of their role, can purchase two different types of upgrades.


1) Fingertip Frenzy, which multiplies the clicking power of the clicking minigame


2) Brass Knuckles (for Robbers)  / Power of Justice (for Cops), which increases the damage you do.
